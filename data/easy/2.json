    "The ACE2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called angiotensin-coverting enzyme 2.  The ACE2 protein can be found on the cell membrane of a diverse range of cells in the body.",
    "ACE2 has been identified as the primary receptor for the binding of SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).",
    "The inhibition, or modification of ACE2 is considered one of the prominent strategies for the treatment of COVID-19."
